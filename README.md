Impact Analysis of Socioeconomic and Lifestyle Factors on High School Performance in Portugal

Overview:
This project delves into understanding how various socioeconomic and lifestyle factors affect the academic performance of high school students in Portugal. By examining a unique dataset encompassing factors like family income, parental education, social habits, and more, this research provides insights into the complex dynamics affecting student success in Portuguese language classes.

Context:
- This project aims to analyze the impact of various socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, such as income level, parental education, and social habits on Portuguese high school students' academic performance in their Portuguese language class.
- Many of these lifestyle factors are usually not collected in general census data that aids in similar large-scale education studies.

Hypothesis:
Socioeconomic factors such as parental education level  and  family income, along with lifestyle habits like study time, internet access, and social activities, significantly influence the academic performance of high school students.

Key Features:
- Focus on a range of both qualitative and quantitative factors not typically covered in general census data.
- Examination of unique lifestyle factors like family relationships, free time, internet access, and others.
- Application of machine learning techniques to identify patterns and predict trends in academic performance.

Stakeholders:
This research holds significant value for educational policymakers, school administrators, and teachers worldwide. Insights gleaned from this study can help:
- Identify and address social issues affecting student performance.
- Tailor educational approaches to meet diverse student needs.
- Implement targeted interventions for improved educational outcomes.

Data Source:
The dataset used for this analysis comes from Kaggle, consisting of data from two Portuguese high schools. It includes:
- Information from 649 students with 34 features each.
- Data collection through school reports and questionnaires.
- Features engineered for optimal representation of student performance.

Machine Learning Methods:
We employed various techniques to analyze the data, focusing on robust models like Random Forest Regression, XGB Gradient Boosting, and Decision Trees. Our approach also includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand grading systems and trim correlated features.
- Feature Engineering, including one-hot encoding and binning of grades.
- Evaluation metrics like RMSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
  
Results and Implications:
Our findings support the hypothesis that socioeconomic and lifestyle factors significantly influence academic performance. Key outcomes include:
- Improved model accuracy by categorizing grades into binary pass/fail.
- Identification of socioeconomic disparities in educational success.
- Recommendations for resource allocation, curriculum changes, and creating an equitable learning environment.
  
Confounding Variables:
- Limited sample size from two schools.
- Focus on the Portuguese language class, which may not generalize across all subjects.
- Cultural and regional differences within Portugal that could affect the results.

Conclusion:
This project contributes to the understanding of the multifaceted factors impacting student performance in Portugal. By leveraging machine learning, we offer valuable insights for educational improvements and a step towards a more equitable educational system.
